\Chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{What are we going to do?}
This article try to combine reliable Quasi-Monte Carlo methods with control variates based on digital sequences.

\paragraph{Why this is a good idea?} 
Control Variates is proved to be able to increase efficiency of MC. If we can work it out with QMC, it will further improve the speed of cubSobol algorithm. And this is especially useful to problems where we can easily find good control variates.

\paragraph{What's the challenge?}
As is already shown[ref], one problem is that optimal solution of beta is different between MC and QMC. Hence, we need to find a new way computing beta for QMC.
 
\paragraph{Outline}
In chapter 2 we brief introduce MC,CV and QMC.
In chapter 3 we show the theory and algorithm of this method.
In chapter 4 we do several numerical experiments.
