\par  This dissertation could not have been written without Dr. X
who not only served as my supervisor but also encouraged and
challenged me throughout my academic program. He and the other
faculty members, Dr. Y and Dr. Z, guided me through the
dissertation process, never accepting less than my best efforts. I
thank them all.\\ \\ (Don't copy this sample text. Write your own
